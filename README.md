# Intrusion-Detection-System-with-Machine-learning
This project is to design and implement a machine learning-based Intrusion Detection System using the Random Forest algorithm to accurately identify and classify network threats. This involves utilizing the NSL-KDD dataset for training, where raw network traffic data is preprocessed, and label-encoded to ensure compatibility with the model.

# üõ°Ô∏è Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with Flask & Random Forest

This project is a lightweight Intrusion Detection System (IDS) built using Python, Flask, and a Random Forest classifier. It uses the NSL-KDD dataset for training and allows real-time traffic analysis through a web interface and an API.
