# Intrusion-Detection-System-with-Machine-learning
This project is to design and implement a machine learning-based Intrusion Detection System using the Random Forest algorithm to accurately identify and classify network threats. This involves utilizing the NSL-KDD dataset for training, where raw network traffic data is preprocessed, and label-encoded to ensure compatibility with the model.
